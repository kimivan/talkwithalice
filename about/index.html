            <h1>I'm Alice Kim</h1>
            <p class="large">I'm a Brazilian-Korean-American Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC) and National
                Certified Counselor (NCC) based in Atlanta, GA.
            </p>
            <p>
                I profoundly believe in the transformative power of psychotherapy and the strength within every
                individual to create meaningful change in their life. With a foundation of honesty, compassion,
                authenticity, inclusivity, and growth, I approach every session with professionalism and care. I am
                committed to helping you achieve both personal insight and lasting change, supporting you on your
                journey to a healthier, more balanced life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Growing up with diverse cultural influences, I know firsthand how culture, identity, and personal
                experiences shape who we are. This perspective allows me to empathize with clients from all backgrounds,
                especially those navigating cultural adjustment, identity exploration, or balancing multiple identities.
                As a therapist, I prioritize creating a safe, non-judgmental space where you can process your
                experiences and explore the many layers of your well-being.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not in session, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, writing music, traveling, and
                indulging in a delicious plate of pasta.
            </p>

        <section class="row">
            <h2>My Approach</h2>
            <p>My goal as a therapist isn't just to 'fix' problems but to help you gain deeper insight into your
                emotions, relationships, and behaviors.
            </p>
            <p>I'm committed to offering treatment options that are uniquely suited to your goals. Together, we'll
                explore your challenges and develop actionable solutions using a blend of evidence-based therapies
                tailored to your needs.
            </p>
            <p>I incorporate a range of evidence-based therapies, including EMDR, Psychodynamic Therapy, Person-Centered
                Therapy, Somatic Therapy, Narrative Therapy, Motivational Interviewing, Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy
                (CBT), and Mindfulness. Each of these approaches offers valuable tools to help you process emotions,
                shift unhelpful patterns, and build a stronger, more fulfilling life.
