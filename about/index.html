                <h1>I'm Alice Kim</h1>
                <p class="largehero">I'm a Brazilian-Korean-American Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC) and National
                    Certified Counselor (NCC) based in Atlanta, GA.
                </p>
                <p>I profoundly believe in the transformative power of psychotherapy and the strength within every
                    individual to create meaningful change in their life. With a foundation of honesty, compassion,
                    authenticity, inclusivity, and growth, I approach every
                    session with professionalism and care. I am committed to helping you achieve both personal insight
                    and lasting change, supporting you on your journey to a healthier, more balanced life.
                </p>
                <p>Growing up with diverse cultural influences, I know firsthand how culture, identity, and personal
                    experiences shape who we are. This perspective allows me to empathize with clients from all
                    backgrounds, especially those navigating cultural adjustment, identity exploration, or balancing
                    multiple identities. As a therapist, I prioritize creating a safe, non-judgmental space where you
                    can process your
                    experiences and explore the many layers of your well-being.
                </p>
                <p>When I'm not in session, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, writing music, traveling, and
                    indulging in a delicious plate of pasta.

                    into your emotions, relationships, and behaviors.
                </p>
                <p>I'm committed to offering treatment options that are uniquely suited to your goals. Together, we'll
                    explore your challenges and develop actionable solutions using a blend of
                    evidence-based therapies tailored to your needs. I incorporate the following therapeutic approaches:
