                <p>Are you feeling stuck, overwhelmed, or unsure of what's wrong? In our sessions, you'll find a safe,
                    judgment-free space to explore your emotions, relationships, and behaviors with deeper insight.
                </p>
                <p>I blend empathy with evidence-based techniques—such as EMDR, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT),
                    Psychodynamic, Person-Centered, Somatic, Narrative, Motivational Interviewing, and mindfulness—to
                    tailor
                    our work to your unique needs.
                </p>
                <p>I profoundly believe in the transformative power of psychotherapy and am committed to helping you
                    achieve
                    lasting change. Together, we can develop new thought patterns and practices for a more balanced,
                    fulfilling life.

                <p>Growing up with diverse cultural influences, I know firsthand how culture, identity, and personal

                    backgrounds, offering a culturally aware and inclusive approach to therapy.
                </p>
                <p>My academic background includes a Master's in Clinical Mental Health Counseling from Northwestern

                </p>
                <p>When I'm not in session, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, writing music, traveling, and
